# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers two distinct user interface enhancements for the Flea Market App: a user-accessible language selector and a light/dark mode toggle. These features will improve user experience by allowing visitors to customize the interface to their preferences without requiring admin access.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Language Selector

**User Story:** As a visitor to the flea market website, I want to change the interface language without needing admin access, so that I can browse items in my preferred language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the main page THEN they SHALL see a language selector in the top navigation area
2. WHEN a user clicks the language selector THEN they SHALL see available language options (Swedish and English)
3. WHEN a user selects a different language THEN the interface SHALL immediately switch to that language
4. WHEN a user changes the language THEN their preference SHALL be remembered for future visits
5. WHEN the language changes THEN the currency format SHALL automatically update to match the language (SEK for Swedish, USD for English)
6. WHEN a user has no stored preference THEN the language SHALL default to the admin-configured site language
7. WHEN the language selector is displayed THEN it SHALL show the current language with appropriate flag icons or language codes
8. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the language selector SHALL be accessible and touch-friendly

### Requirement 2: Light/Dark Mode Toggle

**User Story:** As a user browsing the flea market website, I want to switch between light and dark themes, so that I can use the site comfortably in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN they SHALL see a theme toggle button in the top navigation area
2. WHEN a user clicks the theme toggle THEN the website SHALL switch between light and dark modes
3. WHEN in light mode THEN the toggle SHALL display a moon icon indicating the option to switch to dark mode
4. WHEN in dark mode THEN the toggle SHALL display a sun icon indicating the option to switch to light mode
5. WHEN the theme changes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and visually appealing
6. WHEN a user selects a theme THEN their preference SHALL be stored locally and remembered for future visits
7. WHEN a user has no stored preference THEN the theme SHALL default to light mode
8. WHEN in dark mode THEN all text SHALL remain readable with appropriate contrast ratios
9. WHEN in dark mode THEN images and item cards SHALL maintain visual appeal
10. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the theme toggle SHALL be easily accessible and functional
11. WHEN the user's system preference is set to dark mode THEN the website SHALL respect this preference on first visit
12. WHEN switching themes THEN all page elements including navigation, cards, buttons, and forms SHALL update consistently

### Requirement 3: Integration and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want both the language selector and theme toggle to work seamlessly together and with existing features, so that I have a consistent and reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both language and theme preferences are set THEN they SHALL work independently without conflicts
2. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN both language and theme preferences SHALL persist
3. WHEN using the search and sort features THEN language and theme preferences SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN viewing the image gallery THEN the selected theme SHALL apply to the gallery interface
5. WHEN accessing admin features THEN the theme preference SHALL apply to admin pages as well
6. WHEN the mobile navigation menu is open THEN both controls SHALL be accessible and functional
7. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the language selector SHALL still function via server-side handling
8. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the theme SHALL gracefully fall back to light mode
